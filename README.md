# Automatic Screenshot Maker

This is a program  for taking screenshots regularly.  
A period is set by you. The default one is 5 minutes.  
You also can set a destination folder for screenshots.  

This program is useful in case you want something simpler than cumbersome time-trackers for logging and analysing your own activity.
